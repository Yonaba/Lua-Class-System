#LCS : Lua Class System#
*Lua Class System* (LCS) is a small library which offers a clean, minimalistic but powerful API for (Pseudo) Object Oriented programming style using Lua.
LCS is light-weight, abstract thus can fit in every project where OOP mechanisms are needed.

  
##Usage##
Add [LCS.lua](https://github.com/Yonaba/Lua-Class-System/blob/master/LCS.lua) file inside your project.<br/>
Call it using __require__ function.</br>
It will return a table containing a set of functions.
	
##Full API Overview##
* __LCS.class(args)__  : Creates a class
* __LCS.class.final(args)__  : Creates a final class.
* __LCS.class.abstract(args)__  : Creates a static class.
* __LCS.is_A(thing,kind)__  : Checks the nature of the given argument 'thing'.
* __class(args)__ : Default class constructor used for instantiation.
* __class:new(args)__ : Same as class(args)__
* __class:extends(args)__ : Returns a new class derived from class class.
* __class:getClass()__ : Returns a reference to the superclass of class class 
* __class:getSubClasses()__ : Returns a list of all classes deriving from class class 
* __class:super(method,...)__ : Calls a method defined in a parent of class class
* __instance:getClass()__ : Returns a reference to the class from which 'instance' was created
* __instance:is_A(aClass)__ : Checks if instance instance was instantiated from a specific class.
* __instance:super(method,...)__ : Calls a methods defined in a parent of a class from which object 'instance' was created

##Printing classes and objects
As of [v1.2](https://github.com/Yonaba/Lua-Class-System/blob/master/version_history.md), a light feature have been added.<br/>
Any attempt to [print](http://pgl.yoyo.org/luai/i/print) or [tostring](http://pgl.yoyo.org/luai/i/tostring) a class/instance will return a custom string, 
as shown in the following:

```lua
local LCS = require 'LCS'
-- A Cat Class
local Cat = LCS.class({name = 'Animal'})
-- Init
function Cat:init(name)
  self.name = name
end

print(Cat) --> "class: <table: 0058C4C0>"

local kitten = Cat('kitty')
print(kitten) --> "object: <table: 0058C628>"
````

Yet, this behaviour can still be easily overriden if you want to provide your own output.
Just attach a method named <tt>describe</tt> to the class.

```lua
local LCS = require 'LCS'
-- A Cat Class
local Cat = LCS.class({name = 'Animal'})
-- Init
function Cat:init(name)
  self.name = name
end

print(Cat) --> "class: <table: 0058C4C0>"

local kitten = Cat('kitty')
print(kitten) --> "object: <table: 0058C628>"

-- Now providing a describe method to have our own output
function Cat:describe()
  return self.name
end

print(Cat) --> "Animal"
print(kitten) --> "kitty""
````

__Note__: <tt>describe</tt> method can be passed a variable number of arguments.
